### Model:

![](client/src/images/project_model.jpeg)

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- sqlite3

### Install the Latest Ruby Version

Check your Ruby version:

```console
$ ruby -v
```

I recommend version 2.7.4, but to install:

```console
$ rvm install 2.7.4 --default
```

Also install the latest versions of `bundler` and `rails`:

```console
$ gem install bundler
$ gem install rails
```

## Setup

Start by **cloning** the project:
the remote:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:ChristopherAPerez/phase-4-project-one-piece-forum.git
```

Then, `cd` phase-4-project-one-piece-forum:

```console
$ cd phase-4-project-one-piece-forum
```

Once inside the file, you may run:

```console
$ bundle install
```

This will allow all the necessary gemfiles to install. You may also see the gems by entering:

```console
$ gem list
```

Next:

```console
$ rails db:create
```

Next, focus on the frontend needs:

```console
$ npm install --prefix client
```

After, run the migrations and use the provided seeds.rb file to `seed` the database. This will provide data for the application.

```console
$ rails db:migrate db:seed
```

```console
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, you can start your server with with `rails s server` in a seperate terminal.

```console
$ rails s
```

After, start the react-app, also in a seperate terminal:

```console
$ npm start â€” prefix client
```

And you've set up the frontend and backend for the appilcation!
